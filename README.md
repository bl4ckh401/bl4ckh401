### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Pavin
#### As a Crypto Community Manager and a Solidity(Blockchain) Developer, I combine my passion for blockchain technology and software development with my knack for fostering vibrant online communities. I have a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from The Catholic University of Eastern Africa, where I honed my skills in TypeScript, JavaScript, Node.js, React.js,  React Native and other web development tools.

I love creating smart contracts, NFT marketplaces, and dApps on various blockchain platforms, such as Ethereum, BSC, and Polygon. I also leverage popular SDKs, such as Moralis and Thirdweb e.t.c , to enhance the user experience and functionality of my applications. Additionally, I develop Telegram bots for trading automation, such as sniper bots, sandwicher bots, and copy-trader bots. I am always eager to learn new trends and innovations in the crypto space, and I enjoy sharing my insights and engaging with users on various social media channels. My goal is to bring innovation to life through blockchain and to empower people with decentralized solutions.

Skills: REACT / JS / HTML / CSS / DJANGO / PYTHON / C# / GIT VERSION CONTROL / NODE etc
