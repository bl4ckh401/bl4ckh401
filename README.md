### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Pavin
As a DeFi Analyst and a Solidity(Blockchain) Developer, I combine my passion for blockchain technology and software development with my knack for fostering vibrant online communities.

I love creating smart contracts, NFT marketplaces, and dApps on various blockchain platforms, such as Ethereum, BSC, and Polygon. I also leverage popular SDKs, such as Moralis and Thirdweb e.t.c , to enhance the user experience and functionality of my applications. Additionally, I develop Telegram bots for trading automation, such as sniper bots, sandwicher bots, and copy-trader bots. I am always eager to learn new trends and innovations in the crypto space, and I enjoy sharing my insights and engaging with users on various social media channels. My goal is to bring innovation to life through blockchain and to empower people with decentralized solutions.
